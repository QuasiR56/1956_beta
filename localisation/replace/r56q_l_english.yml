 r56q.event.1.d:0 "Earlier this morning, a significant number of reports confirmed that Rome has fallen to advancing German forces. After a decisive offensive, the Italian government saw no choice but to abandon their capital and flee to one of their few remaining strongholds. A few fervent Italian soldiers have chosen to disregard their orders and continue the fight on their own, but all in all, the entire city save for Tiber iIsland and Viminal Hill is now under German control. \n\nAn impromptu tank parade has been organized in the ruins of the Circus Maximus, and the event can be seen as an allegory for the whole conflict - just as the iron treads of the German Panzers crush the fragile foundations of the historical site, the German nation itself has crushed the Italians with a series of devastating battles. \n\nWill they be able to turn the tide, or will they perish?"
